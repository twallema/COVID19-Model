## Future work

### Model dynamics

Future work will include a modification of the model dynamics most likely according to the flowchart below, this will be done in collaboration with hospitals. We believe these will allow to simulate the disease spread even more realisticly.

### Scenario-specific functions

We will implement a function which uses the past policies to quickly recreate the Belgian ICU and hospitalisation curves up-to-date. This function will be used to quickly propose MPC optimal policies and to perform scenario analysis about the future.
